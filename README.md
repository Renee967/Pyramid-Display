# Pyramid-Display



Write a program that prompts the user to enter the year and first day of the year and displays on the console the calendar table for the year. For example, if the user entered the year 2005, and 6 for Saturday, January 1, 2005, your program should display the calendar for each month in the year, as follows:



            

                            
                           


                
(Hint: the number of days in February for the different years may be different, which depends on whether it is a leap year or plain year. A year is a leap year if either (1) or (2) holds: (1) it is divisible by 400. (2) it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100.
